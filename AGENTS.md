# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The root `Dockerfile` builds the `andgineer/allure` image and defines the pinned Allure release, Java runtime, and supporting Python utilities. Keep sample result assets under `allure-results/`; generated HTML belongs in `allure-report/` and can be cleared safely. Document usage updates in `README.md` and agent-specific context in `CLAUDE.md` whenever behaviour or dependencies change.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the Docker CLI for build and smoke-test workflows. Build the image locally with:
```bash
docker build -t andgineer/allure .
```
Regenerate a report from the provided fixtures by mounting results and reports:
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/allure-results:/allure-results -v ${PWD}/allure-report:/allure-report andgineer/allure allure generate /allure-results -o /allure-report --clean
```
Verify the container serves output correctly:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8800:80 -v ${PWD}/allure-results:/allure-results andgineer/allure allure serve -h 0.0.0.0 -p 80 /allure-results
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Keep Dockerfile instructions ordered: package installation, environment setup, runtime defaults. Use lowercase, dash-separated filenames for helper scripts and reserve uppercase snake case for environment variables such as `ALLURE_VERSION`. Shell snippets should be POSIX-compatible and linted with `shellcheck` when practical. Avoid trailing whitespace and prefer two-space indentation in YAML or Compose examples.

## Testing Guidelines
No automated tests run in CI; rely on functional checks. After modifying the Dockerfile or dependencies, rebuild the image and rerun the `allure generate` and `allure serve` commands with the bundled fixtures to confirm Java, Python, and Allure executables resolve correctly. Capture any non-zero exit codes or warnings in the PR description.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing history: short, imperative commit subjects (e.g., `upgrade allure runtime`). Group related changes per commit and avoid WIP messages. PRs should explain the motivation, outline test evidence, and link issues when applicable; attach screenshots of the generated report UI if output changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Respect the pinned Maven URL and `ALLURE_VERSION`; bump both together and describe the reason in the PR. Do not add secrets to the imageâ€”prefer runtime environment variables or mounted credentials. Review base image CVEs before release by running `docker scout cves andgineer/allure`.
